# react-native-capture-sandbox 1.0.3

This is the sandbox version of react-native-capture that is generated from the sanbox version of capturesdk-reactnative-sandbox.

This project is meant to simulate the result of the CI/CD jobs in the SDK's gitlab-ci.yml file.

_note: version above may be different from actual version for react-native-capture but the versioning logic should operate the same way._
